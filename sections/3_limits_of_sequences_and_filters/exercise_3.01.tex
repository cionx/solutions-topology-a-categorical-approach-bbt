\subsection{Exercise~3.1}



\subsubsection{a)}

Let~$g, g' \colon X \to Y$ be two continuous extensions of~$f$.
We know from \cref{equalizers into hausdorff spaces are closed} that the set
\[
	E ≔ \{ x ∈ X \suchthat g x = g' x \}
\]
is closed in~$X$.
The set~$E$ contains the dense subset~$A$ of~$X$, whence~$E = X$.
In other words,~$g = g'$.



\subsubsection{b)}
Let~$X$ be any topological space and let~$A$ be a proper dense subset of~$X$.
Let~$Y$ be an indiscrete topological space and let~$f$ be any map from~$A$ to~$Y$.
The map~$f$ is automatically continuous, and every extension of~$f$ to a map from~$X$ to~$Y$ will also be continuous.
Such extensions correspond to maps from~$X ∖ A$ to~$Y$.
So if we additionally require~$Y$ to have at least two distinct elements, then there will be multiple extensions.



\subsubsection{c)}

The subset~$A ≔ [-1, 1] ∖ \{ 0 \}$ of the closed interval~$X ≔ [-1, 1]$ is dense, and the function~$f \colon A \to ℝ$ given by~$f x = 1 / x$ for every~$x ∈ A$ is continuous.
Suppose that~$f$ could be extended to a continuous map~$g$ from~$X$ to~$ℝ$.
The image of~$g$ would be a compact subset of~$ℝ$, and therefore bounded.
This implies that the image of~$f$ would be bounded in~$ℝ$, which is not the case.
