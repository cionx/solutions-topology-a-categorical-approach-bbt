\subsection{Exercise~3.7}

The set~$X$ belongs to~$\filter{F}$, and we have~$f X = Y$.
Therefore,~$Y$ belongs to the proposed filterbase, which entails that it is nonempty.

Let~$B$ and~$B'$ be two sets belonging to the proposed filterbase.
This means that there exist sets~$A$ and~$A'$ belonging to~$\filter{F}$ with~$f A ⊆ B$ and~$f A' ⊆ B'$.
The intersection~$A ∩ A'$ again belongs to~$\filter{F}$, and we have
\[
	f (A ∩ A')
	⊆
	f A ∩ f A'
	⊆
	B ∩ B' \,.
\]
This tells us that the intersection~$B ∩ B'$ is again contained in the proposed filterbase, which shows that it is downward directed.
