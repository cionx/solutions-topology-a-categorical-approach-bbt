\subsection{Exercise~3.8}
\label{exercise 3.8}

Let~$B$ be a subset of~$Y$ not belonging to~$f_* \filter{F}$.
This means that the preimage~$f^{-1} B$ does not belong to~$\filter{F}$.
There hence exists by Proposition~3.1 a set~$A$ belonging to~$\filter{F}$ with~$A ∩ f^{-1} B = ∅$.
This means that no point of~$A$ is mapped into~$B$ by the map~$f$, whence~$f A ∩ B = ∅$.
But the set~$f A$ is contained in~$f_* \filter{F}$.

According to Proposition~3.1, we have shown that the filter~$f_* \filter{F}$ is again an ultrafilter.
