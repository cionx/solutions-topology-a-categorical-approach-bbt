\subsection{Exercise~3.12}

For every set~$X$ its power set~$2^X$ is a poset via
\[
	A ⪯ B \iff A ⊆ B \,.
\]
With this partial order, Definition~3.10 specializes to Definition~3.4.

\begin{remark}
	If the poset~$\mathcal{P}$ admits binary meets, then an upwards closed subset~$\filter{F}$ of~$\mathcal{P}$ is downward directed if and only if~$a ∧ b ∈ \filter{F}$ for any two elements~$a$ and~$b$ of~$\filter{F}$.
\end{remark}
