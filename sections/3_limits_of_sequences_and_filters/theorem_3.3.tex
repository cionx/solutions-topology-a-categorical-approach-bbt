\subsection{Theorem~3.3}

For every open neighbourhood~$U$ of~$x$ there exists some index~$N$ with~$x_n ∈ U$ for every~$n ≥ N$.
This entails that~$U$ and~$\{ x_n \suchthat n ≥ 0 \}$ intersect, whence~$U$ and~$A$ intersect.

This shows that every open neighbourhood of~$x$ intersects the set~$A$, which tells us that~$x$ is contained in the closure of~$A$ (by \cref{closure via intersection with neighbourhoods}, page~\pageref{closure via intersection with neighbourhoods}).
