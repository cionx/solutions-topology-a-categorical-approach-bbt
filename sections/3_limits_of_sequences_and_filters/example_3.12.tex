\subsection{Example~3.12}

Let~$\filter{I}$ be a collection of subsets of~$X$ with the following three properties:
\begin{itemize*}

	\item
		The empty set belongs to~$\filter{I}$.

	\item
		For every two sets belonging to~$\filter{I}$, their union again belongs to~$\filter{I}$.

	\item
		For every set belonging to~$\filter{I}$, all its subsets again belong to~$\filter{I}$.

\end{itemize*}
Then the set~$\{ X ∖ A \suchthat A ∈ \filter{I} \}$ is a filter on~$X$.

We can choose for~$\filter{I}$ the collection of all finite subsets of~$X$.
The resulting filter is then the Fréchet filter, which is thus indeed a filter.
