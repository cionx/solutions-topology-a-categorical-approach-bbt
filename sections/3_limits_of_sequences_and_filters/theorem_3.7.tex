\subsection{Theorem~3.7}

In view of Theorem~3.4 it remains to show that if the map~$f$ preserves convergence of sequences, then it is continuous.
To this end, we show that for every closed subset~$C$ of~$Y$ its preimage~$f^{-1} C$ is closed in~$X$.

Let~$(x_n)_n$ be a sequence in~$f^{-1} C$ with~$(x_n)_n \to x$ for some point~$x âˆˆ X$.
Then~$(f x_n)_n \to f x$ and the sequence~$(f x_n)_n$ lies completely in~$C$.
It follows from Theorem~3.6 (and Theorem~3.3) that~$f x$ also lies in~$C$.
Therefore,~$x$ lies in~$f^{-1} C$.
According to Theorem~3.6 we have shown that~$f^{-1} C$ is closed in~$X$.
