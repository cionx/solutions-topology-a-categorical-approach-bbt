\subsection{Corollary~3.12.1}

Suppose first that~$X$ is a compact Hausdorff space.
Every prime filter on~$X$ converges by Theorem~3.12, and its limit point is unique by Theorem~3.8.

Suppose now that every prime filter on~$X$ admits a unique limit point.
It follows from Theorem~3.12 that~$X$ is compact.
To show that~$X$ is a Hausdorff space we use Theorem~3.8, and will show that limit points of filters on~$X$ are unique.
So let~$\filter{F}$ be any filter on~$X$.
By the Ultrafilter Lemma, the filter~$\filter{F}$ is contained in an ultrafilter~$\filter{U}$.
Every limit point of~$\filter{F}$ is also a limit point of~$\filter{U}$, and the filter~$\filter{U}$ is prime by Theorem~3.11.
As~$\filter{U}$ has a unique limit point,~$\filter{F}$ has at most one limit point.
