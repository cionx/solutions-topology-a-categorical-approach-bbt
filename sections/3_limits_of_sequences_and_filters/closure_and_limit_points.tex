\subsection{Closure in Terms of Limit Points}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{closure via intersection with neighbourhoods}
	Let~$X$ be a topological space, let~$B$ be a subset of~$X$ and let~$x$ be a point in~$X$.
	The following conditions on~$x$ and~$B$ are equivalent:
	\begin{equivalenceslist}

		\item
			\label{contained in the closure}
			The point~$x$ in contained in the closure of~$B$.

		\item
			\label{every neighbourhood intersects}
			Every neighbourhood of~$x$ intersects~$B$.

		\item
			\label{every open neighbourhood intersects}
			Every open neighbourhood of~$x$ intersects~$B$.

	\end{equivalenceslist}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Conditions~\ref{every neighbourhood intersects} and~\ref{every open neighbourhood intersects} are equivalent because every neighbourhood contains an open neighbourhood.
	We have also the chain of equivalences
	\begin{align*}
		{}&
		x ∉ \closure{B} \\
		\iff{}&
		\text{$x ∉ C$ for some closed subset~$C$ of~$X$ with~$B ⊆ C$} \\
		\iff{}&
		\text{$x ∈ U$ for some open subset~$U$ of~$X$ disjoint to~$B$} \\
		\iff{}&
		\text{some open neighbourhood of~$x$ doesn’t intersect~$B$} \,,
	\end{align*}
	which gives the equivalence of Conditions~\ref{contained in the closure} and~\ref{every open neighbourhood intersects}.
\end{proof}

Let~$X$ be a topological space, let~$B$ be a subset of~$X$, and let~$B'$ be the set of limit points of~$B$.
We have for every point~$x$ of~$X$ the chain of equivalences
\begin{align*}
	{}&
	x ∈ \closure{B}
	\\
	\iff{}&
	\text{every open neighbourhood of~$x$ intersects~$B$}
	\\
	\iff{}&
	\left\{
		\begin{tabular}{@{}l}
			every open neighbourhood of~$x$ intersects~$B ∖ \{ x \}$, \\
			or otherwise~$x ∈ B$
		\end{tabular}
	\right.
	\\
	\iff{}&
	\text{$x ∈ B'$ or~$x ∈ B$} \\
	\iff{}&
	x ∈ B' ∪ B \,.
\end{align*}
This shows the claimed equality~$\closure{B} = B' ∪ B$.
