\subsection{Proof of Tychonoff’s Theorem}

Let us make an observation from the presented proof more explicit.

\begin{proposition}
	Let~$(X_α)_{α ∈ A}$ be a family of topological spaces with product~$X ≔ ∏_{α ∈ A} X_α$, and for every index~$α$ let~$π_α$ be the canonical projection from~$X$ to~$X_α$.
	Let~$\filter{F}$ be a filter in~$X$ and let~$x = (x_α)_α$ be a point in~$X$.
	The filter~$\filter{F}$ converges to the point~$x$ if and only if for every index~$α$ the filter~$(π_α)_* \filter{F}$ converges to~$x_α$.
\end{proposition}

In other words:
convergence of filters on product spaces works component\-wise.

\begin{proof}
	If the filter~$\filter{F}$ converges to the point~$x$, then for every index~$α$ its pushforward~$(π_α)_* \filter{F}$ converges to the point~$π_α x = x_α$, by the continuity of~$π_α$ and Theorem~3.10.

	Suppose conversely that for every index~$α$ the pushforward~$(π_α)_* \filter{F}$ converges to the point~$x_α$.
	To show that the original filter~$\filter{F}$ converges to the point~$x$, we need to show that every open neighbourhood~$V$ of~$x$ is contained in~$\filter{F}$.

	There exists a basic open neighbourhood~$U$ of~$x$ with~$U ⊆ V$.
	This neighbourhood~$U$ is thus of the form
	\[
		U = π_{α_1}^{-1} U_1 ∩ \dotsb ∩ π_{α_n}^{-1} U_n
	\]
	for some distinct indices~$α_1, \dotsc, α_n$ and open subsets~$U_i$ of~$X_{α_i}$.
	By assumption,~$U_i$ belongs to~$(π_α)_* \filter{F}$ for every index~$i$, which means that the preimage~$π_{α_i}^{-1} U_i$ belongs to~$\filter{F}$ for every index~$i$.
	It follows that~$U$ again belongs to~$\filter{F}$ because filters are closed under taking intersections.
	It further follows that~$V$ belongs to~$\filter{F}$ because filters are upward closed.
\end{proof}
