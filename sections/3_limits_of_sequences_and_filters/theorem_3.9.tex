\subsection{Theorem~3.9}

It follows from \cref{generic criterion for convergence of a filterbase} that the filter generated by~$\filterbase{B}$ converges to~$x$.
This filter contains~$A$ since~$X ∩ A = A$ belongs to~$\filterbase{B}$.

The filter~$\filter{F}$ contains the set~$A$, and it also contains all open neighbourhoods of~$x$ because~$\filter{F}$ converges to~$x$.
Consequently, all intersections~$U ∩ A$ with~$U$ an open neighbourhood of~$x$ are contained in~$\filter{F}$.
In other words,~$\filterbase{B}$ is contained in~$\filter{F}$.
