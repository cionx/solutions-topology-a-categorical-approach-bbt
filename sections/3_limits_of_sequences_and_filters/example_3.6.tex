\subsection{Example~3.6}



\subsubsection{The Map~$I$ is Not Continuous}

If~$I$ were continuous then the preimage~$U ≔ I^{-1} [0, 1)$ would be a nonempty open subset of~$Y$.
There would hence exist a basic open set~$V$ of~$[0, 1]^{[0, 1]}$ such that~$Y ∩ V$ is nonempty and~$Y ∩ V ⊆ U$.
There then exist distinct points~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ of~$[0, 1]$ and open subsets~$V_1, \dotsc, V_n$ of~$[0, 1]$ such that
\[
	V
	=
	\{
		f \colon [0, 1] \to [0, 1]
		\suchthat
		f(x_i) ∈ \text{$V_i$ for every~$i$}
	\} \,.
\]
It follows that
\[
	Y ∩ V
	=
	\{
		f ∈ Y
		\suchthat
		f(x_i) ∈ \text{$V_i$ for every~$i$}
	\} \,.
\]
The set~$V$ is nonempty, so each~$V_i$ is nonempty.
We choose for every index~$i$ some point~$y_i$ in~$V_i$ and consider the function
\[
	f
	\colon
	[0, 1] \to [0, 1] \,,
	\quad
	x
	\mapsto
	\begin{cases*}
		y_i & if~$x = x_i$ for some~$i$, \\
		1   & otherwise.
	\end{cases*}
\]
This function is contained in~$Y$ and has~$I f = 1$, since it is constant with value~$1$ almost everywhere.
But~$f$ is also contained in~$Y ∩ V$ and thus in~$U$, whence~$I f < 1$.
A contradiction!



\subsubsection{The Map~$I$ Preserves Convergence of Sequences}

Let~$(f_n)_n$ be a sequence in~$Y$ with~$(f_n)_n \to f$ for some function~$f$ in~$Y$.
According to \cref{convergece of sequences in products is coordinate-wise} (page~\pageref{convergece of sequences in products is coordinate-wise}) this means that the sequence~$(f_n)_n$ converges pointwise to~$f$.

The functions~$f_n$ are dominated by the function with constant value~$1$, which is again integrable.
It follows from the dominated convergence theorem that~$I f_n = ∫_0^1 f_n \to ∫_0^1 f = I f$ as~$n \to ∞$.
