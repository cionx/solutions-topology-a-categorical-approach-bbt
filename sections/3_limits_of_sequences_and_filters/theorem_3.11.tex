\subsection{Theorem~3.11}

There is a typo in the first part of the proof:
it is not the claimed intersection~$(A ∪ B) ∩ (A' ∪ B')$ that needs to be empty, but instead the intersection
\[
	(A ∪ B) ∩ (A' ∩ B') \,.
\]
The set~$A' ∩ B'$ again belongs to~$\filter{F}$, and since the filter~$\filter{F}$ is a proper, it can therefore not contain the set~$A ∪ B$.
