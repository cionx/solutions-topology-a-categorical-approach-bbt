\subsection{Definition 0.3}

For every open subset~$U$ of~$X$, its preimage~$\id_X^{-1} U = U$ is open in~$X$.
Therefore,~$\id_X$ is continuous.

Let~$f \colon X \to Y$ and~$g \colon Y \to Z$ be two composable continuous maps.
Let~$U$ be an open subset of~$Z$.
The preimage~$g^{-1} U$ is open in~$Y$ because~$g$ is continuous.
Hence, the preimage~$f^{-1} g^{-1} U$ is open in~$X$ because~$f$ is continuous.
But we have~$f^{-1} g^{-1} U = (g f)^{-1} U$.
We have thus shown that the composite~$g f$ is continuous.
