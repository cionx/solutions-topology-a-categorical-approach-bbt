\subsection{Exercise 0.2}

Let~$\basis{B}$ be a basis for the topology on~$Y$.

Suppose first that~$f$ is continuous.
Every element of~$\basis{B}$ is an open subset of~$Y$, whence its preimage under~$f$ is an open subset of~$X$.

Suppose now that~$f^{-1} B$ is open in~$X$ for every element~$B$ of~$\basis{B}$.
Let~$U$ be an arbitrary open subset of~$Y$.
We have seen in \cref{characterizations of bases} that the set~$U$ is a union of sets that belong to~$\basis{B}$.
There hence exists a family~$(B_α)_{α ∈ A}$ of elements of~$\basis{B}$ such that~$U = ⋃_{α ∈ A} B_α$, and we have
\[
	f^{-1} U
	=
	f^{-1} ⋃_{α ∈ A} B_α
	=
	⋃_{α ∈ A} f^{-1} B_α \,.
\]
The last term is open in~$X$ because each~$f^{-1} B_α$ is open in~$X$ by assumption, and unions of open subsets are again open.
This shows that~$f^{-1} U$ is open in~$X$ for every open subset~$U$ of~$Y$.
In other words,~$f$ is continuous.
