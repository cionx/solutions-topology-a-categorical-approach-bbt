\subsection{First Example}

The given indexing category
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[sep = small, row sep = normal]
		\bigbullet
		\arrow{rrr}
		\arrow{drr}
		&
		{}
		&
		{}
		&
		\bigbullet
		\\
		{}
		&
		{}
		&
		\bigbullet
		\arrow{ur}
		&
		{}
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
does not have three morphisms, as claimed in the book, but six morphisms:
apart from the three non-identity morphisms we have also an identity morphism for each of the three objects.
