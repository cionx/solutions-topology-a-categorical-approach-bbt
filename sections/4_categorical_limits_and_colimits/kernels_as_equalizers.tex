\subsection{Kernels as Equalizers}

In algebraic categories such as~$\Grp$,~$\Vect{ùïú}$ and~$\Mod{R}$, the equalizer of two parallel homomorphisms
\[
	f, g \colon X \to Y
\]
can be computed as
\[
	E ‚âî \{ x ‚àà X \suchthat f x = g x \} \,,
\]
which is a substructure of~$X$, together with the inclusion homomorphism from~$E$ to~$X$.
It follows for the trivial homomorphism~$t$ from~$X$ to~$Y$ that the equalizer of~$t$ and~$f$ is given by
\[
	\{ x ‚àà X \suchthat f x = t x \}
	=
	\{ x ‚àà X \suchthat f x = 0 \}
	=
	\ker f
\]
together with the inclusion homomorphism from~$\ker f$ to~$X$.
(For the sake of this argument, we denote for every group its neutral element by~$0$.)
