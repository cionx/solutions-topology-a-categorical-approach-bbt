\subsection{Point-Shaped Diagrams}

One might argue that a \enquote{point-shaped diagram}, when regarded as a functor, is not necessarily constant:
the actions of the functor on morphisms may be non-trivial.
The diagram could be therefore look as follows:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\bigbullet
		\arrow[loop, out = 40,  in = 100, looseness = 7]
		\arrow[loop, out = 160, in = 220, looseness = 7]
		\arrow[loop, out = 280, in = 340, looseness = 7]
	\end{tikzcd}
\]

The book probably means that a diagram is \emph{defined} as \enquote{point-shaped} if and only if as a functor, it is constant.
