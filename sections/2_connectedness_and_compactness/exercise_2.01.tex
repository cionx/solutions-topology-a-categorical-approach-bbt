\subsection{Exercise~2.1}
\label{exercise 2.1}

We show that for every topological space~$X$ the following two conditions are equivalent:
\begin{equivalenceslist*}

	\item
		The space~$X$ cannot be expressed as a union of two disjoint nonempty open subsets.

	\item
		Every continuous map from~$X$ to~$\{ 0, 1 \}$ is constant, where~$\{ 0, 1 \}$ is equipped with the discrete topology.

\end{equivalenceslist*}

Maps~$f \colon X \to \{ 0, 1 \}$ are in one-to-one correspondence to disjoint decompositions~$X = A ∪ B$, via~$A = f^{-1} \{ 0 \}$ and~$B = f^{-1} \{ 1 \}$.
The two constant maps correspond to the two decompositions~$X = X ∪ ∅$ and~$X = ∅ ∪ X$ respectively.

If we endow~$\{ 0, 1 \}$ with the discrete topology, then the map~$f$ is continuous if and only if for the corresponding decomposition~$X = A ∪ B$ both~$A$ and~$B$ are open.

We find overall that continuous, non-constant maps from~$X$ to the discrete space~$\{ 0, 1 \}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with decompositions of~$X$ into two open, nonempty disjoint subsets.
The existence of such a map is therefore equivalent to the existence of such a decomposition.
