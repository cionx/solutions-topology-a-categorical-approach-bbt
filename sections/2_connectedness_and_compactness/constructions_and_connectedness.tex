\subsection{Constructions and Connectedness~(2.1.3)}

We have seen that~$ℝ$ is connected, but its subspace~$ℚ$ is note.
Therefore, connectedness is not inherited by subspaces.

That the disjoint union of two connected spaces won’t be connected is only true if both spaces are also assumed to be nonempty.
