\subsection{Exercise~2.24}



\subsubsection{a)}

Let~$\top{T}$ be some topology on~$[0, 1]$ that is finer than the standard topology, and such that~$([0, 1], \top{T})$ is compact.
According to Corollary~2.18.2, the identity map of~$[0, 1]$ is then a homeomorphism from~$([0, 1], \top{T})$ to~$[0, 1]$ with the standard topology.
This tells us that~$\top{T}$ agrees with the standard topology on~$[0, 1]$.



\subsubsection{b)}

Let~$\top{T}$ be some topology on~$[0, 1]$ that is coarser than the standard topology, and such that~$([0, 1], \top{T})$ is a Hausdorff space.
According to Corollary~2.18.2, the identity map of~$[0, 1]$ is then a homeomorphism from~$[0, 1]$ with the standard topology to~$([0, 1], \top{T})$.
This tells us that~$\top{T}$ agrees with the standard topology on~$[0, 1]$.
