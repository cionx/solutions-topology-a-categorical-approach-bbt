\subsection{Theorem~2.15}

Let~$f \colon X \to Y$ be a surjective continuous map and suppose that~$X$ is compact.
We show that~$Y$ is again compact.

Let~$\cover{V}$ be an open cover for~$Y$.
The collection~$\cover{U} ≔ \{ f^{-1} V \suchthat V ∈ \cover{V} \}$ is an open cover for~$X$.
By the compactness of~$X$, there exist finitely many sets~$U_1, \dotsc, U_n ∈ \cover{U}$ with~$X = U_1 ∪ \dotsb ∪ U_n$.
Let~$V_1, \dotsc, V_n ∈ \cover{V}$ with~$U_i = f^{-1} V_i$ for every index~$i$.
It follows from the surjectivity of~$f$ that~$f U_i = V_i$, and thus
\[
	Y
	=
	f X
	=
	f ⋃_{i = 1}^n U_i
	=
	⋃_{i = 1}^n f U_i
	=
	⋃_{i = 1}^n V_i \,.
\]
This shows that the cover~$\cover{V}$ admits a finite subcover.
