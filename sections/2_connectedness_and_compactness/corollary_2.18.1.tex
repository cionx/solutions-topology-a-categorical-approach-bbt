\subsection{Corollary~2.18.1}

Let~$X$ be a Hausdorff space and let~$K$ be a compact subspace of~$X$.
We know from Theorem~2.18 that there exist for every point~$x$ in~$X$ with~$x ∉ K$ open subsets~$U_x$ and~$V_x$ of~$X$ with~$x ∈ U_x$ and~$K ⊆ V_x$.
It follows that~$X ∖ K = ⋃_{x ∈ X ∖ K} U_x$ is a union of open sets, and therefore itself open.
