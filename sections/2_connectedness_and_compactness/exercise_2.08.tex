\subsection{Exercise~2.8}

Suppose that~$ℚ$ is locally compact.
Then there exists a neighbourhood~$U$ of~$0$ and a compact subset~$K$ of~$ℚ$ with~$U ⊆ K$.

The neighbourhood set~$U$ contains an open interval~$(-ε, ε)_ℚ$ for some~$ε > 0$, and therefore a closed interval~$[-δ, δ]_ℚ$ for some~$δ > 0$.
The interval~$[-δ, δ]$ is closed in~$ℝ$, whence~$[-δ, δ]_ℚ = [-δ, δ] ∩ ℚ$ is closed in~$ℚ$.
It follows that~$[-δ, δ]_ℚ$ is again compact, as it is a closed subspace of~$K$.

We may choose the radius~$δ$ as irrational.
We then have~$[-δ, δ]_ℚ = (-δ, δ)_ℚ$.
But~$(-δ, δ)_ℚ$ is not compact, since it admits the open cover
\[
	\{ (-δ, x)_ℚ \suchthat x ∈ (-δ, δ)_ℚ \}
\]
which does not admit a finite subcover.
A contradiction!
