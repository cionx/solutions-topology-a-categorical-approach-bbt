\subsection{Corollary~2.18.4}

Let~$K$ be a compact topological space and let~$f$ be a continuous function from~$K$ to~$ℝ$.
The image~$f X$ is a compact subspace of~$ℝ$, and is therefore both bounded and closed by the Heine--Borel theorem.
It follows that both~$\sup f X$ and~$\inf f X$ are real (since~$f X$ is bounded) and again contained in~$f X$ (because~$f X$ is closed).
This means that~$f$ attains both a maximum and a minimum.
