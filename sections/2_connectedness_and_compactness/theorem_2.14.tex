\subsection{Theorem~2.14}

We show that for every topological space~$X$ the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{equivalenceslist}

	\item
		\label{space is hausdorff}
		$X$ is a Hausdorff space.

	\item
		\label{diagonal set is closed}
		The diagonal set~$Δ_X = \{ (x, x) \suchthat x ∈ X \}$ is closed in~$X × X$.

	\item
		\label{diagonal map is closed}
		The diagonal map~$Δ \colon X \to X × X$,~$x \mapsto (x, x)$ is closed.

\end{equivalenceslist}

We note that two subsets~$U$ and~$V$ of~$X$ are disjoint if and only if the subset~$U × V$ of~$X × X$ is disjoint to~$Δ_X$.
For the equivalence of~\ref{diagonal set is closed} and~\ref{space is hausdorff} we observe the chain of equivalences

For the equivalence of~\ref{diagonal set is closed} and~\ref{space is hausdorff} we note that the two maps
\[
	φ \colon X \to Δ_X \,, \quad x \mapsto (x, x)
\]
and
\[
	ψ \colon Δ_X \to X \,, \quad (x, x) \mapsto x
\]
are continuous and mutually inverse.
(The continuity of~$φ$ follows from the universal property of the product topology and the universal property of the subspace topology.
The map~$ψ$ is continuous because it is the restriction of the canonical projection maps.)
The maps~$φ$ and~$ψ$ are mutually inverse, whence~$φ$ is a homeomorphism with inverse~$ψ$.

Suppose that~$Δ_X$ is closed in~$X$.
Then for every subset~$C$ of~$Δ_X$, the set~$C$ is closed in~$Δ_X$ if and only if~$C$ is closed in~$X × X$.
It follows for every subset~$C$ of~$X$ that
\begin{align*}
	\SwapAboveDisplaySkip
	{}&
	\text{$C$ is closed in~$X$} \\
	\iff{}&
	\text{$φ C$ is closed in~$Δ_X$} \\
	\iff{}&
	\text{$φ C$ is closed in~$X × X$} \\
	\iff{}&
	\text{$Δ C$ is closed in~$X × X$} \,.
\end{align*}
This means that the map~$Δ$ is closed.

If conversely~$Δ$ is closed, then it follows in particular that~$Δ X$ is closed in~$X × X$.
But~$Δ X = Δ_X$.
