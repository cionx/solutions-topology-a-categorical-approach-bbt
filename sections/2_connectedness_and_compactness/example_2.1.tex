\subsection{Example~2.1}

Let~$X$ be a subspace of~$ℚ$ that consists of at least two distinct elements$~x$ and~$y$.
We may assume that~$x < y$.
There exists an irrational number~$a$ with~$x < a < y$.
The sets
\[
	U = \{ z ∈ X \suchthat z < a \} \,,
	\quad
	V = \{ z ∈ X \suchthat z > a \}
\]
are disjoint, nonempty, and open in~$X$, with~$X = U ∪ V$.
The existence of these sets shows that~$X$ is not connected.

This shows that~$ℚ$ is indeed totally disconnected.
