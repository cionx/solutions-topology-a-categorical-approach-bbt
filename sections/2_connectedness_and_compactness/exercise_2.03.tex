\subsubsection{Countable Metric Spaces are Disconnected}

Let~$X$ be a countable topological space that contains at least two distinct points~$x$ and~$y$.
We consider the continuous function~$f ≔ d(x, \ph)$ from~$X$ to~$ℝ$.
We have~$f x = 0$ but~$f y > 0$.
The image of~$f$ is a countable subset of~$ℝ$, so there exists some real number~$c$ with~$0 < c < f y$ that is not contained in the image of~$f$.
It follows that
\[
	U ≔ f^{-1} (-∞, c) \,,
	\quad
	V ≔ f^{-1} (c, ∞)
\]
are two disjoint nonempty open subsets of~$X$ with~$X = U ∪ V$.
This shows that the space~$X$ is not connected.



\subsubsection{Both Countable and Connected}

Every indiscrete topological space is connected.
Every countable indiscrete topological space is both countable and connected.
