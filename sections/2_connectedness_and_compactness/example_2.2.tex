\subsection{Example~2.2}

We denote the given space by
\[
	X = \{ 0 \} × [-1, 1] ∪ \{ (x, \sin(1/x)) \suchthat x > 0 \} \,.
\]



\subsubsection{$X$ is connected}

The space~$X$ consists of two components:
the line~$L ≔ \{ 0 \} × [-1, 1]$ and the curve~$C = \{ (x, \sin(1 / x)) \suchthat x > 0 \}$.
Both subspaces of~$X$ are connected since they are the images of connected spaces under continuous maps, namely
\[
	[0, 1] \to L \,, \quad t \mapsto (0, 2t - 1)
\]
and
\[
	(0, ∞) \to C \,, \quad x \mapsto (x, \sin(1 / x)) \,.
\]
(These maps are in fact homeomorphisms).

Let~$f \colon X \to \{ 0, 1 \}$ be a continuous map, where~$\{ 0, 1 \}$ is endowed with the discrete topology.
The map~$f$ is constant on both~$L$ and~$C$.
Let~$x ≔ (0, 0)$ and let~$c ≔ f x$.
The preimage~$f^{-1} \{ c \}$ is an open subset of~$X$ containing~$x$.
There hence exists some~$ε > 0$ for which the set~$\ball(x, ε) ∩ X$ is contained in~$f^{-1} \{ c \}$.
The set~$\ball(x, ε) ∩ X$ contains the point~$x$ of the line~$L$ but also points of the curve~$C$.
It follows that~$f$ is constant with value~$c$, since~$f$ is constant on both~$L$ and~$C$.

This shows that the space~$X$ is connected.



\subsubsection{$X$ is not path connected}

Let $x_0 ≔ (1/(\pi/2), 1) ∈ C$, and suppose that there exists a path~$γ \colon [0, 1] \to X$ from~$x_0$ to~$x = (0, 0)$.
Let~$π$ be the projection from~$ℝ^2$ to~$ℝ$ restricted to a continuous map from~$X$ to~$[0, ∞)$.
The composite~$π γ$ is a path in~$[0, ∞)$ from~$1/(\pi/2)$ to~$0$.
It follows from repeated usage of the intermediate value theorem that there exist an increasing sequence
\[
	\frac{1}{\pi/2} = t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < t_3 < \dotsb ≤ 1
\]
with
\[
	π γ t_n = \frac{1}{(n + \frac{1}{2}) \pi}
\]
for every~$n ≥ 0$.
It follows that
\[
	γ t_n = ( t_n, (-1)^n )
\]
for every~$n ≥ 0$.
The sequence~$(t_n)_n$ is strictly increasing and bonded from above, and thus convergent.
It follows that the sequence~$(γ t_n)_n$ again converges, because~$γ$ is continuous.
By projecting onto the second coordinate, we finally find that the sequence~$( (-1)^n )_n$ converges.
What nonsense!
