\subsection{Exercise~2.22}

The statement is false:
we can endow every set~$S$ with either the discrete topology or the indiscrete topology, resulting in topological spaces~$X$ and~$Y$ respectively.
The identity map of~$S$ is a continuous bijection from~$X$ to~$Y$.
But~$X$ is always a Hausdorff space, whereas~$Y$ is a Hausdorff space if and only if the underlying set~$S$ is either empty or a singleton set.
