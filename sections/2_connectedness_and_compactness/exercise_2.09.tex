\subsection{Exercise~2.9}

\begin{lemma}
	Let~$X$ and~$Y$ be two topological spaces.
	Let~$N$ and~$M$ be neighbourhoods of points~$x$ and~$y$ in~$X$ and~$Y$ respectively.
	Then~$N × M$ is a neighbourhood of~$(x, y)$ in~$X × Y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	There exist open neighbourhoods~$U$ and~$V$ of~$x$ and~$y$ respectively.
	The subset~$U × V$ is an open neighbourhood of~$(x, y)$ with~$U × V ⊆ N × M$.
\end{proof}

We have already seen that arbitrary products of Hausdorff spaces are again Hausdorff spaces.
This holds in particular for binary products.

Suppose that~$X$ and~$Y$ are two locally compact topological spaces.
Let~$(x, y)$ be a point in~$X × Y$.
There exist by assumption neighbourhoods~$U$ and~$V$ of~$x$ and~$y$ respectively and compact subsets~$K$ and~$L$ of~$X$ and~$Y$ respectively such that~$U ⊆ K$ and~$V ⊆ L$.
The set~$U × V$ is a neighbourhood of~$(x, y)$, and~$U × V ⊆ K × L$.
The subspace topology of~$K × L$ (coming from the product topology of~$X × Y$) agrees with the product topology of~$K × L$, whence~$K × L$ is compact by Tychonoff’s theorem.
