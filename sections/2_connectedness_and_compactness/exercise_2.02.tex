\subsection{Exercise~2.2}

Let~$f \colon X \to Y$ be a continuous map between two topological spaces~$X$ and~$Y$
We have the set-theoretic decomposition~$X = ∐_{y ∈ Y} f^{-1} y$.

Suppose that~$f$ is locally constant.
For every value~$y ∈ Y$, the fibre~$f^{-1} y$ is then a neighbourhood for each of its points.
In other words, each fibre~$f^{-1} y$ is open.
We have thus the decomposition~$X = ∐_{y ∈ Y} f^{-1} y$ into open subsets.

Suppose additionally that~$X$ is connected.
Then it follows that only one of the fibres of~$f$ can be nonempty.
Therefore,~$f$ is constant.
