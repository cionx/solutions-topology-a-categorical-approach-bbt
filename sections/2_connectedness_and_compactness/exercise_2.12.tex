\subsection{Exercise~2.12}

There exists for every point~$x$ of~$X$ an open neighbourhood~$U x$ of~$x$ belonging to~$\cover{U}$.
There hence exists some radius~$δ x > 0$ with~$\ball(x, δ x) ⊆ U x$.
The open cover~$\{ \ball(x, δ x / 2) \suchthat x ∈ X \}$ admits a finite subcover by the compactness of~$X$.
Consequently, there exist finitely many points~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ in~$X$ with
\[
	X = \ball(x_1, δ {x_1} / 2) ∪ \dotsb ∪ \ball(x_n, δ {x_2} / 2) \,.
\]

Let~$y$ be an arbitrary point in~$X$.
Then for some index~$i$, the point~$y$ lies in the open ball~$\ball(x_i, δ {x_i} / 2)$.
It follows for~$ε ≔ \min(δ {x_1} / 2, \dotsc, δ {x_n} / 2)$ (which does not depend on~$y$) from the triangle inequality that
\[
	\ball(y, ε)
	⊆ \ball(x_i, δ {x_i} / 2 + ε)
	⊆ \ball(x_i, δ {x_i})
	⊆ U x_i \,.
\]
