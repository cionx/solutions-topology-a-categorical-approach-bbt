\subsection{Example~2.6}

The given space~$X$ is not compact since the open cover~$\{ (x, ∞) \suchthat x ∈ X \}$ does not admit a finite subcover.

We note that the limit points of a singleton set~$\{ x \}$ are all those~$y ∈ X$ with~$y < x$.
More generally, for every subset~$S$ of~$X$, the set of limits points of~$S$ consists of all those~$y ∈ X$ for which there exists some~$x ∈ S$ with~$y < x$.
In other words, the set of limit points of~$S$ equals~$(-∞, \sup S)$, with~$\sup S$ possible taking on the value~$∞$.
