\subsection{Example~1.1}

Suppose more generally that~$X$ is a set and~$\top{F}$ is a collection of subsets of~$X$.
There exists a (necessarily unique) topology on~$X$ whose closed sets are the sets belonging to~$\top{F}$ if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize*}

	\item
		Both~$∅$ and~$X$ are contained in~$\top{F}$.

	\item
		$\top{F}$ is closed under intersections.

	\item
		$\top{F}$ is closed under finite unions.

\end{itemize*}
Suppose that a collection~$\top{F}'$ of subsets of~$X$ satisfies the following two conditions.
\begin{itemize*}

	\item
		$\top{F}'$ is nonempty.

	\item
		$\top{F}'$ is closed under finite unions.

	\item
		For every set~$F$ belonging to~$\top{F}'$, all subsets of~$F$ again belong to~$\top{F}'$.

\end{itemize*}
Then~$\top{F} = \top{F}' ∪ \{ X \}$ satisfies the conditions for closed sets of a topology.

It follows for both
\[
	\top{F}'_1 ≔ \{ F ⊆ X \suchthat \text{$F$ is finite} \} ∪ \{ X \}
\]
and
\[
	\top{F}'_2 ≔ \{ F ⊆ X \suchthat \text{$F$ is countable} \} ∪ \{ X \}
\]
that~$\top{F}'_1 ∪ \{ X \}$ and~$\top{F}'_2 ∪ \{ X \}$ form the closed sets for topologies on~$X$.
