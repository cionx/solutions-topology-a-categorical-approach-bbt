\subsection{Better Definition of the Quotient Topology}

The author thinks that the \enquote{word of caution} may be slightly misleading.

The set~$\mathscr{T}$ of topologies on~$X$ forms a partially ordered set with respect to subset inclusion~$⊆$.
For every family~$(\top{T}_α)_{α ∈ A}$ of topologies on~$X$, the intersection~$⋂_{α ∈ A} \top{T}_α$ is again a topology on~$X$;
this is the finest topology on~$X$ that is coarser than all~$\top{T}_α$.
Equivalently, every subset of~$\mathscr{T}$ admits an infimum.

Therefore,~$\mathscr{T}$ is a complete lattice.

But this entails that every subset of~$\mathscr{T}$ also admits a supremum.
In other words, for every family~$(\top{T}_α)_{α ∈ A}$ of topologies on~$X$, there exists a coarsest topology that is finer than all~$\top{T}_α$.
This topology is more explicitly given by the topology generated by the union~$⋃_{α ∈ A} \top{T}_α$.

Suppose now that~$P$ is some property of topologies on~$X$.
This is, for every topology~$\top{T}$ on~$X$, the property~$P(\top{T})$ is either true or false.
We can then consider the set~$\mathscr{T}_P$ of all topologies on~$X$ that satisfy~$P$:
\[
	\mathscr{T}_P = \{ \top{T} ∈ \mathscr{T} \suchthat P(\top{T}) \} \,.
\]
The set~$\mathscr{T}_P$ admits both a supremum~$\top{T}_{\sup}$ and an infimum~$\smash{\top{T}}_{\inf}$ in~$\mathscr{T}$.

There exists a finest topology on~$X$ satisfying~$P$ if and only if~$\smash{\top{T}}_{\sup}$ is contained in~$\mathscr{T}_P$, and there exists a coarsest topology on~$X$ satisfying~$P$ if and only if~$\smash{\top{T}}_{\inf}$ is contained in~$\mathscr{T}_P$.

We see that, at least from a certain theoretical perspective, the issues of having a finest topology satisfying~$P$ and having a coarsest topology satisfying~$P$ are equivalently problematic.

We fix some notation for further use.

\begin{definition}
	\label{notation for infima and suprema of topologies}
	Let~$X$ be a set and let~$\mathscr{T}$ be a collection of topologies on~$X$.
	\begin{enumerate}

		\item
			The coarsest topology on~$X$ that is finer than every topology contained in~$\mathscr{T}$ is denoted by~$⋀ \mathscr{T}$.

		\item
			The finest topology on~$X$ that is coarser than every topology contained in~$\mathscr{T}$ is denoted by~$⋁ \mathscr{T}$.

	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
