\subsection{Example~1.6}

Let~$X ≔ \spec R$.

For~$E = ∅$ we have~$V E = X$, and for $E = R$ we have~$V E = ∅$.
We have for every family~$(E_α)_{α ∈ A}$ of subsets of~$R$ the equality
\[
	⋂_{α ∈ A} V E_α
	=
	V ⋃_{α ∈ A} E_α \,.
\]
This shows that intersections of closed sets are again closed.
To show that finite unions of closed sets are again closed we use the following observation:

\begin{lemma}
	\label{product in prime ideal}
	Let~$R$ be a commutative ring and let~$𝔭$ be a prime ideal of~$R$.
	Let~$E$ and~$F$ be two subsets of~$R$.
	Then~$E F ⊆ 𝔭$ if and only if~$E ⊆ 𝔭$ or~$F ⊆ 𝔭$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	If~$E ⊆ 𝔭$ or~$F ⊆ 𝔭$ then also~$EF ⊆ 𝔭$ because~$𝔭$ is in an ideal.
	Suppose conversely that neither~$E ⊆ 𝔭$ nor~$F ⊆ 𝔭$.
	Then there exist elements~$x ∈ E$ and~$y ∈ F$ with~$x, y ∉ 𝔭$.
	It follows that also~$xy ∉ 𝔭$ because the ideal~$𝔭$ is prime.
	Consequently,~$EF ⊈ 𝔭$.
\end{proof}

It follows from the above \lcnamecref{product in prime ideal} that for all subsets~$E_1, \dotsc, E_n$ of~$R$, we have
\[
	V E_1 ∪ \dotsb ∪ V E_n
	=
	V (E_1 \dotsm E_n) \,.
\]
This shows that finite unions of closed subsets are again closed.
