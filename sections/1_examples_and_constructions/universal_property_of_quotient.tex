\subsection{Universal Property of the Quotient Topology}

Using the notation introduced in \cref{pullback and pushforward of topologies}, the quotient topology on~$S$ is precisely the topology~$Ï€_* \top{T}_X$, where~$\top{T}_X$ is the topology of~$X$.
The desired universal property therefore follows from \cref{universal properties for pullback and pushforward of topologies}.
